Exemples d'utilisation de $\LaTeX{}$ sur le web.

---

Pour mettre du code $\LaTeX{}$ inline, il faut Ã©crire :

	Lorsque $x \lt y$ alors ...

Lorsque $x \lt y$ alors ...

---

Test d'un array :

	\\begin{array}{cc}
	  a & b \\\\
	  c & c
	\\end{array}

\\begin{array}{cc}
  a & b \\\\
  c & c
\\end{array}

---

Test d'une formule :

	$E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

$E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$

---

Test d'un texte :

	$\LaTeX{}$ is a document preparation system for the $\TeX{}$ typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, and much more. $\LaTeX{}$ was originally written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport and has become the dominant method forusing $\TeX$; few people write in plain $\TeX{}$ anymore.
	\\begin{align}
	E_0 &= mc^2
	E &= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	\\end{align}

Test d'une commande inexistante :

	$$\CommandeQuiNexistePas$$

$$\CommandeQuiNexistePas$$

Autre test :

	When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
